.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm openrsync
.Nd synchronise local and remote files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm openrsync
.Op Fl ntv
.Ar src ...
.Ar dst
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility synchronises files in the destination directory
.Ar dst
with one or more source files
.Ar src .
Either the source or the destination (but not both) may be on a remote
host.
If so, the remote host is connected to using
.Xr ssh 1 .
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
Does not actually modify the destination.
.It Fl p
Set destination file permissions to match the source when it is updated.
.It Fl t
Set destination file modification time to match the source when it is
updated or created.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
Specify once for files being transferred, twice for specific status,
thrice for per-file transfer information, and four times for per-file
breakdowns.
.El
.Pp
By default, new destination files are given the current time and the
source file permissions.
.Pp
At this time,
.Ar src
must be a regular file.
The destination must be a directory and is created if not found.
.Pp
.Nm
is compatible with GNU
.Xr rsync 1
protocol version 20, although the GNU utility must be forced to use MD5
hashing as illustrated in the
.Sx EXAMPLES .
